        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a simple recipe for a classic New York style pizza. While the recipe does not include any additional toppings, feel free to have some fun by adding your favorites (pepperoni is always a solid option). This recipe is for a Gozney Roccbox pizza oven, however, if using a convection oven, you may cook the pizza on a pizza stone for 12 minutes at 500F.</p>
        
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>325g 00 Pizza Flour</li>
            <li>100g Wholemean Flour</li>
            <li>665g Warm Water</li>
            <li>1g Fresh Yeast</li>
            <li>28g Fine Sea Salt</li>
            <li>25ml Olive Oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>For the pizza toppings;</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 x 400g Good quality peeled plum tomatoes</li>
            <li>Salt to taste</li>
            <li>1 Block low moisture mozzarella, half grated, half thinly slices</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Cooking Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To make the dough, put the water in the bowl of a mixer and add the yeast. Mix together to dissolve with your fingers before placing on the dough hook attachment and tuning on to its lowest speed.</li>
            <li>Gradually add the flours to the bowl, adding the salt about halfway through adding the flours. Continue to mix on lowest speed for 3-4 minutes.</li>
            <li>Turn the mixer off, add the olive oil to the bowl and leave the dough to rest for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Give the dough a final mix of 1-2 minutes to incorporate the oil before transferring the dough to a workbench. Cover with a bowl and leave to rest for 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Brush the bench lightly with olive oil before dividing the dough into 240g pieces and placing them on the oiled surface. Shape each piece into a dough ball, transfer the dough balls to an airtight tray or container and leave in the fridge for 24 hours.</li>
            <li>Allow your dough balls to sit at room temperature for around 1-2 hours before opening them into pizzas (it’s important to give the gluten time to relax but how long this takes will depend on how hot or cold the environment is!).</li>
            <li>Roccbox needs to be fully saturated with heat with the flame turned down to low – you may need to turn it up slightly in between bakes to ensure the stone floor is at the desired temp (around 350 on the dial 400-420 degrees on the stone floor).</li>
            <li>In a bowl, mix together a handful of 00 flour and a handful of semolina before carefully popping a dough ball into the bowl and coating in the flour mix.</li>
            <li>Open the dough ball into a pizza skin before topping and transferring to your Roccbox peel. Launch the pizza into Roccbox and bake for around 4 1/2 minutes, rotating and turning regularly.</li>
        </ol>
